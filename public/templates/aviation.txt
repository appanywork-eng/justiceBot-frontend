Dear Sir/Ma,

PETITION: Unfair Treatment, Flight Cancellation Without Notice, and Refund Denial

The petitioner respectfully states that a pre-booked flight was cancelled without notice and that passengers who paid higher fares later were prioritised unfairly, in violation of principles of fairness, industry practice, and passenger rights.

The petitioner seeks:
1. Full investigation into the cancellation process.
2. Enforcement of refund obligations to affected passengers.
3. Policy review to prevent recurrence.
4. Appropriate sanctions where misconduct is found.
5. Public communication of corrective measures.

Respectfully submitted,
